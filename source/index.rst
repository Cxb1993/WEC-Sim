WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) 
=========================================
`WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim>`_ is an open-source wave energy converter simulation tool. The code is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver Simscape Multibody. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom. 


Developers and Contributors
---------------------------
WEC-Sim is a collaboration between the `National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) <http://www.nrel.gov/water/>`_ and `Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) <http://energy.sandia.gov/energy/renewable-energy/water-power/>`_, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office. Due to the open source nature of the code, WEC-Sim  has also had many contributions from external collaborators.
