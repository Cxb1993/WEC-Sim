Advanced Features
===================
This sections provides an overview of the advanced features of the WEC-Sim code that were not covered in the `Tutorials <http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/tutorials.html>`_ section.


Nonlinear Hydrodynamic Forces
---------------------------------

WEC-Sim has the option to include the nonlinear restoring and Froude-Krylov forces when solving the system dynamics of WECs, accounting the weakly nonlinear effect on the body hydrodynamics. 

Settings
..........................
The nonlinear hydrodynamics option can be used by setting :code:`simu.nlHydro = 2` or :code:`simu.nlHydro = 1` in your WEC-Sim input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``). Typically, :code:`simu.nlHydro = 2` is recommended if nonlinear hydrodynamic effects need to be used. Note that :code:`simu.nlHydro = 1` only considered the nonlinear restoring and Froude-Krylov forces based on the body position and mean wave elevation. Currently, WEC-Sim’s nonlinear hydrodynamic option may be invoked with regular and irregular waves, finite and infinite depth waves, but not with user-defined irregular waves. 

When the nonlinear hydrodynamics option is specified, the geometry file (``*.stl``), which is only used for visualization purposes in linear simulations, is also used as the discretized body surface on which the nonlinear pressure forces are integrated. A good mesh resolution is required for the geometry file when using the nonlinear hydrodynamic force option. The simulation accuracy will increase with increased surface resolution (i.e. the number of discretized surface panels specified in the .stl file), but the computation time will also significantly increase. 

An option available to reduce the nonlinear simulation time is to specify a nonlinear time step, :code:`simu.dtFeNonlin=N*simu.dt`, where N is number of increment steps. The nonlinear time step specifies the interval at which the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces are calculated. As the ratio of the nonlinear to system time step increases, the computation time is reduced, but again, at the expense of the simulation accuracy.

Tutorial - Heaving Ellipsoid
...................................................................

The body tested in the study is an ellipsoid with a cross- section characterized by semi-major and -minor axes of 5.0 m and 2.5 m in the wave propagation and normal directions, respectively . The ellipsoid is at its equilibrium position with its origin located at the mean water surface. The mass of the body is then set to 1.342×105 kg, and the center of gravity is located 2 m below the origin.

State-Space Representation
---------------------------------
The convolution integral term in the equation of motion can be linearized using the state-space representation, as described in the Theory Section. To use the state-space representation option in the simulation, the user can specify  :code:`simu.ssCalc = 1` in the WEC-Sim input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``). 

Body-To-Body Interaction
---------------------------------
WEC-Sim allows for body-to-body interactions in the radiation force calculation.
That is, the motion of a body causes a force on all other bodies.
The radiation matrices for each body (radiation damping and added mass) required by WEC-Sim and contained in the ``*.h5`` file are of size **[(6\*N), 6]**, where **N** is the total number of hydrodynamic bodies.
By default, there is no body-to-body interactions and only the **[1+6\*(i-1):6\*i, 1:6]** sub-matrices are used for each body, where **i** is the body number.
When body-to-body interactions are used, the augmented **[(6\*N), 6]** matrices are multiplied by concatenated velocity and acceleration vectors of all hydrodynamic bodies.
For example, the radiation damping force for body 2 in a 3-body system with body-to-body interactions would be calculated as the product of a [1,18] velocity vector, and a [18,6] radiation damping coefficients matrix.

To use body-to-body interactions in your WEC-Sim simulation, simply set :code:`simu.b2b = 1` in your input file.

Multiple Condition Runs (MCR)
---------------------------------
WEC-Sim allows users to perform batch runs by typing ``wecSimMCR`` into the MATLAB Command Window. This command executes the Multiple Condition Run (MCR) option, which can be initiated three different ways:

#. Specify a range of sea states and PTO damping coefficients in the WEC-Sim input file, example: 
	``waves.H = 1:0.5:5; waves.T = 5:1:15;``
	``pto(1).k=1000:1000:10000; pto(1).c=1200000:1200000:3600000;``        

#.  Specify the excel filename that contains a set of wave statistic data in the WEC-Sim input file. This option is generally useful for power matrix generation, example:
	``statisticsDataLoad = "<Excel file name>.xls"``

#.  Provide a MCR case *.mat file, and specify the filename in the WEC-Sim input file, example:
	``simu.mcrCaseFile    = '<File name>.mat'``

.. Note::

	For Multiple Condition Runs, the *.h5 hydrodynamic data is only loaded once. To override this default (and reload the *.h5 hydrodynamic data between runs),  set ``simu.reloadH5Data =1`` in the WEC-Sim input file. 


Different Time Step Size
---------------------------------
Typically, 100~500 time steps per wave period is sufficient to provide accurate results for the hydrodynamic force calculations in WEC-Sim simulation. However, smaller time steps may be needed when coupling WEC-Sim with MoorDyn or using PTO-Sim. To reduce the required overall WEC-Sim simulation time, a different time step size can be specified in the WEC-Sim input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``) to account for nonlinear hydrodynamics and for convolution integral calculations, respectively.

N is number of increment steps (default: N=1):

* Nonlinear hydrodynamics calculation - :code:`simu.dtFeNonlin=N*simu.dt` 

* Convolution integral calculation - :code:`simu.dtCITime=N*simu.dt` 

Non-Hydrodynamic Bodies
---------------------------------
For some cases, in order to obtain the correct dynamics, it might be important to model bodies that do not have hydrodynamic forces acting on them.
This could be bodies that are completely outside of the water, but are still connected through a joint to the WEC bodies, or it could be bodies deeply submerged to the point where the hydrodynamics can be neglected.
WEC-Sim allows for bodies which have no hydrodynamic forces acting on them, and for which no BEM data is provided.

To do this, use a regular *body block* and define it in the *input file* as any other body, leaving the name of the *h5* file as an empty string.
Specify :code:`body(i).nhBody = 1;` and specify body name, mass, moments of inertia, cg, geometry file, location, and displaced volume. 
You can also specify visualization options and initial displacement.


Decay Tests
---------------------------------
When performing simulations of decay tests you must use one of the no-wave cases, and setup the initial (time = 0) location of each body, constraint, PTO, and mooring block.
The initial location of a body or mooring block is set by specifying the CG or location at the stability position (as with any WEC-Sim simulation) and then specifying an initial displacement.
To specify an initial displacement, the body, and mooring blocks have a :code:`.initDisp` property with which you can specify a translation and angular rotation about an arbitrary axis.
For the constraint and PTO blocks, the :code:`.loc` property must be set to the location at time = 0.

There are methods available to help setup this initial displacement for all bodies, constraints, PTOs, and moorings.
To do this you would use the :code:`body(i).setInitDisp(...);`, :code:`constraint(i).setInitDisp(...)`, :code:`pto(i).setInitDisp(...)`, and :code:`mooring(i).setInitDisp(...)` method in the *input file*.
A description of the rquired input can be found in the method's header comments.
Note that :code:`body(i).cg`, :code:`constraint(i).loc`, :code:`pto(i).loc`, and :code:`mooring.ref` must be defined prior to using the object's :code:`.setInitDisp` method.


Advanced Constraints and PTOs
---------------------------------
The default linear and rotational constraints and PTOs are allow for heave and pitch motions of the follower relative to the base.
To obtain a linear or rotational constraint in a different direction you must modify the constraint's or PTO's coordinate orientation.
The important thing to remember is that a linear constraint or PTO will always allow motion along the joint's Z-axis, and a rotational constraint or PTO will allow rotation about the joint's Y-axis.
To obtain translation along or rotation about a different direction relative to the global frame, you must modify the orientation of the joint's coordinate frame.
This is done by setting the constraint's or PTO's :code:`orientation.z` and :code:`orientation.y` properties, which specify the new direction of the Z- and Y- joint coordinates.
The Z- and Y- directions must be perpendicular to each other.

As an example, if you want to constrain body 2 to surge motion relative to body 1 using a linear constraint, you would need the constraint's Z-axis to point in the direction of the global surge (X) direction.
This would be done by setting :code:`constraint(i).orientation.z=[1,0,0]` and the Y-direction to any perpendicular direction (can be left as the default y=[0 1 0]).
In this example the Y-direction would only have an effect on the coordinate on which the constraint forces are reported, but not on the dynamics of the system.
Similarly if you want to obtain a yaw constraint you would use a rotational constraint and align the constraint's Y-axis with the global Z-axis.
This would be done by setting :code:`constraint(i).orientation.y=[0,0,1]` and the  z-direction to a perpendicular direction (say [0,-1,0]).


Additionally, by combining constraints and PTOs in series you can obtain different motion constraints. 
For example, a massless rigid rod between two bodies, hinged at each body, can be obtained by using a two rotational constraints in series, both rotating in pitch, but with different locations.
A roll-pitch constraint can also be obtained with two rotational constraints in series; one rotating in pitch, and the other in roll, and both at the same location. 

Advanced Body Mass and Geometry
---------------------------------
The mass of each body must be specified in the *input file*.
For the case of a floating body, the user has the option of setting :code:`body(i) = 'equilibrium'` in which case WEC-Sim will calculate the correct mass based on displaced volume and water density.
For the case of a fixed body, for which the mass is unknown and not important to the dynamics, you can specify :code:`body(i) = 'fixed'` which will set the mass to 999 kg and moment of inertia to [999 999 999].

To read in the geometry (stl) into Matlab use the :code:`body(i).bodyGeo` method, and the mesh details (vertices, faces, normals, areas, centroids) will be read into the :code:`body(i).bodyGeometry` property.
This is done automatically when using non-linear hydrodynamics or outputting ParaView visualization files.
You can then visualize the geometry using the :code:`body(i).plotStl` method.
